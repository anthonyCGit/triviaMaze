# TriviaMaze
**Goal:** Develop an interactive maze that prompts trivia questions which are stored in a local database.

**Outcome:** Managed to successfully build a functioning program while managing team struggles.

**Team:** Leader, Designer, Programmer in team of 3

**Languages:** Java, SQLite

**Notes:** The project is set up for use as a Eclipse project. Throughout the project our team struggled with working on the project due to outside issues. In an attempt to rectify the situation I spoke with both other members. Ultimately, I was left to complete the project on my own.
